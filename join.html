<p><h3>Why join here?</h3>
By signing up through this website or in person with a delegate from our branch, half of your dues will go directly to benefit the New York City IWW General Membership Branch (GMB) and you will be officially recognized as a member of the branch; signing up through <a href="https://iww.org">iww.org</a> will mean all of your dues go to the North American organization and you may be looped out of our branch's activity.<br><br>
If you want to start paying dues directly to our branch instead of GHQ, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/dues">click here.</a><br><br>
If you are not located in or around NYC, <a href="https://www.iww.org/branches">look for your local branch</a> or <a href="https://www.iww.org/content/join-one-big-union">join as an at-large member</a>.<br><br>
<h3>Who can join the IWW?</h3>
As long as you are a worker — not an employer — you can join the IWW. Members of other unions (except officers), students, retirees, the unemployed, the self-employed, those in informal professions, and those unable to work may also join. <a href="https://wobblycity.org/why-join">Learn why you should join the IWW.</a><br><br>
<h3>Choosing an IU</h3>
You can choose an Industrial Union based on your current job. If you're not sure what to choose — for example, if you're currently not working or are a student — select "Other," and we'll get in touch with you to figure out an appropriate IU.<br><br>
